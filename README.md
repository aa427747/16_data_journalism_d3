Unit 16 D3 Homework

The "simple.js" is the basic chart and the "complex.js" file was intended to be the more advance.  The simple is complete and should provide the data.  The complex will provide one level of data and I have the axis headings, but haven't been able to determine how correctly re-render the chart on click.
